#### a Haskell implementation of the classic arcade game

**how to play**:  compile and run with ` ghc Galaga.hs && ./Galaga`. Follow the game instructions.

**additional features** : I've implemented an explosion animation for the ship and the enemies when each collides with bullets (or each other).

**how the score is calculated** : If the player has killed of enemies, the score is calculated by multiplying the number of enemies * 10.
